VERSION: 3.0.0
CHANGES: A re-write of version 2.9.9. This version extracts the prices and item titles and stores them in two lists. The lists are used to create a dictionary, the dictionary is sorted by price then each entry of the dictionary is printed. The following bug is corrected: versions 2.0.0-2.9.9 extracted all prices but not all of these were relevant. This version only extracts the line price.

VERSION: 3.9.0
CHANGES: Significant re-write. The 3.0.1 code has been turned into modules: one for Tesco and one for Sainsbury's. More can be added as we go along. The main.py file will import code from the modules and execute it. The code to grab the html has also been outsourced to a module: fetcher.py as it's not possible to have it in main (due to dependency issues) and I don't want to copy the fetch code into the shop modules as that would be rather messy.
